# 🧮 React Calculator App 

This is a small learning project: a simple, interactive calculator built with **React** and **Math.js** as part of my mini project practice.

## 🚀 Features

- **Basic arithmetic operations** — addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division  
- **Clear (C) button** — reset the calculator display  
- **Dynamic display** — updates in real-time as you type  
- **Error handling** — gracefully handles invalid expressions  

## 📚 Concepts Practiced

- React component structure and **state management** with `useState`  
- **Dynamic rendering** with `.map()` for button creation  
- **Event handling** in React (`onClick`)  
- Error handling in React using `try/catch`  
- Integrating an **external math library** (`mathjs`) for expression evaluation
