# ✅ To-Do App — React Mini Project

This is a small learning project: a simple and functional **to-do list app** built with React and JavaScript, as part of my practice with component-based development and state management using hooks.

## 🚀 Features

- 📝 Add new tasks  
- ✅ Mark tasks as completed  
- ❌ Delete tasks  
- 📊 Live count of completed tasks  
- 💾 Component-based structure  
- 📐 Responsive and clean layout  

## 📚 Concepts Practiced

- React `useState` hook for state management  
- Passing props between components  
- Mapping and filtering arrays to update UI  
- Conditional rendering (e.g., showing completed tasks count)  
- Clean separation of logic across components (`Header`, `Input`, `TaskList`, `Footer`)  
- Basic UX considerations (e.g., keeping UI reactive and intuitive)
