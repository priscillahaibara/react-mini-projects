# 🧮 Counter App — React Mini Project

This is a small learning project: a simple interactive counter built with **React** and **JavaScript**, as part of my practice with React fundamentals and component-based development.

## 🚀 Features

- ➕ Increase the counter  
- ➖ Decrease the counter (does not go below zero)  
- 🔁 Reset the counter to zero  
- ✅ Prevents negative values  
- 🎨 Inline styling using JavaScript objects  
- 📐 Responsive layout with Flexbox  

## 📚 Concepts Practiced

- React state management with `useState`  
- Functional state updates (e.g. `setCount(c => c + 1)`)  
- Event handling in React  
- Conditional logic for UX (e.g. disabling decrement at 0)  
- Inline CSS-in-JS styling  
- Clean component structure
